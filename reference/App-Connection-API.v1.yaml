        To get information about an App Connection, you must set the `AppToken` header with the API Token returned from the App Connection Portal.

        To figure out the App Connection and printer's state, you can use a combination of the API return type as well as the `IsOnline` flag in the resposne body. 

        **Note! There are some HTTP status codes in the 6xx range!** These are custom OctoEverywhere HTTP status codes that are used for the App Connection relay system. We share the same custom status codes here to keep things consistent.
